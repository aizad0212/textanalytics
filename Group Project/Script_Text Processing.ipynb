Requested to check another round, they said ok, went in and came back out with the paper bag fully packed, not letting us check the order.\\n\\nIt's ok if you don't have the part, just tell me instead of saying will check but come out and give us cold chicken and wrong parts without even saying a single word.\\n\\nAlso, when ordering, the server girl cut us off before we even finished our sentence. She didn't even know what we were gonna say. Seems like she's been doing this to many customers. Why does McD hire such rude workers?  \n",

       "1      worst service ever, when requested for chicken part, they said will check for me but after that they brought out the wrong parts. requested to check another round, they said ok, went in and came back out with the paper bag fully packed, not letting us check the order. it's ok if you don't have the part, just tell me instead of saying will check but come out and give us cold chicken and wrong parts without even saying a single word. also, when ordering, the server girl cut us off before we even finished our sentence. she didn't even know what we were gonna say. seems like she's been doing this to many customers. why does mcd hire such rude workers?\n",

       "1      worst service ever, when requested for chicken part, they said will check for me but after that they brought out the wrong parts. requested to check another round, they said ok, went in and came back out with the paper bag fully packed, not letting us check the order. it's ok if you don't have the part, just tell me instead of saying will check but come out and give us cold chicken and wrong parts without even saying a single word. also, when ordering, the server girl cut us off before we even finished our sentence. she didn't even know what we were gonna say. seems like she's been doing this to many customers. why does mcdonald's hire such rude workers?\n",

       "1      worst service ever when requested for chicken part they said will check for me but after that they brought out the wrong parts requested to check another round they said ok went in and came back out with the paper bag fully packed not letting us check the order it is ok if you do not have the part just tell me instead of saying will check but come out and give us cold chicken and wrong parts without even saying a single word also when ordering the server girl cut us off before we even finished our sentence she did not even know what we were gonna say seems like she is been doing this to many customers why does mcdonalds hire such rude workers\n",

Requested to check another round, they said ok, went in and came back out with the paper bag fully packed, not letting us check the order.\\n\\nIt's ok if you don't have the part, just tell me instead of saying will check but come out and give us cold chicken and wrong parts without even saying a single word.\\n\\nAlso, when ordering, the server girl cut us off before we even finished our sentence. She didn't even know what we were gonna say. Seems like she's been doing this to many customers. Why does McD hire such rude workers?   \n",
